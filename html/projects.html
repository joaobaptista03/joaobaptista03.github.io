            <h3>Block Dude (Haskell)</h3>
            <p>The first project I made while studying Computer Science and Engineering (1st year - 1st semester). It is a game made in Haskell by me and Mariana Pinto that was inspired by the already known Block Dude.</p>

            <h3>Stack Oriented Language Interpreter (C)</h3>
            <p>This was the second project me and 2 more friends made during the 1st year of the degree. Basically, it interprets an input line and make some calculations, screen printing, among many other things.</p>

            <h3>Taxi Database Dashboard (C)</h3>
            <p>The last project I accomplished was a Database Dashboard for a Taxi company, given some CSV files with the information of the Users, Drivers and Rides, it could make some calculations and write the result in a output file.</p>
