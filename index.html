                <p>Hello, my name is Jo達o Pedro Baptista and I am a third-year student pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Universidade do Minho, located in Braga, Portugal. As an aspiring software developer, I am constantly exploring and expanding my skills, and I invite you to discover my programming projects showcased on this website.</p>
                <p>I have worked in multiple projects, using languages like C, C#, Java, Python, and Haskell. I've learned HTML, CSS, JS (and Node), SQL, and MATLAB as well, but I am more used to Software Programming.</p>
                <p>The repositories started with "UMinho" are projects developed in the course. All the others are Own Projects that I developed in order to enhance my programming skills.</p>
